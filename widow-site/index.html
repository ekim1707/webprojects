    <p>At first, nobody even really acknowledges you. But after your first few headshots, it feels like everything's suddenly completely personal...<br><br>
    First they start by sending a gigantic super-leaping monkey with a Tesla Cannon after you... Then comes along an expert-hacker spy who can be invisible whenever she wants.<br><br>
    Next up is a robotic, diabolical-looking ninja with a devastating Katana blade, capable of deflecting literally... (pause for emphasis)... anything, including stuff like missiles and fireblasts (forreal?).<br><br>
    And of course it's always wonderful when that psychopathic terrorist with dual-wielding hellfire shotguns, wraith-mode, and the ability to teleport finally shows up.<br><br>
    You've managed to piss them all off, and now you've got to stay alive using just your slow-charge rifle, single-use-only escape grapple, and that small ray of hope that you can achieve that no-margin-for-error shot accuracy that's necessary to survive everybody diving you over and over again.<br>
    <br>Fun times.<br><br><br><br>
