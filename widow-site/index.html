    <h3>It's almost always the same....</h3>
    <p>At first, nobody even really acknowledges you. But after your first few headshots, it feels like it's suddenly completely personal...</p>
    <p>First they start by sending a gigantic super-leaping monkey with a Tesla Cannon after you... Then comes along an expert-hacker spy who can be invisible whenever she wants.</p>
    <p>Next is a robotic, diabolical-looking ninja with a devastating Katana blade, capable of deflecting literally... (pause for emphasis)... anything, including stuff like missiles and fireblasts.</p>
    <p>And of course it's always wonderful when that psychopathic terrorist with dual-wielding hellfire shotguns, wraith-mode, and the ability to teleport finally shows up.</p>
    <p>You've managed to piss them all off, and now you've got to stay alive using just your slow-charge rifle, single-use-only escape grapple, and some kind of unreal, zero margin-for-error shot accuracy that you have to pull out of... idk, somewhere...</p>
    <p>Fun times.</p>
