    <p><br><br><br>Sneaky, Sneaky Soldier</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I actually did this again later with Symmetra as well, and it ended with just as amazing results. I think I had this 100% designed in my head coming out of spawn after I saw the time remaining in the game and my ult charge. I knew I would have ult at the exact moment I reached that platform, so I was pretty confident about it from the start I guess.</li>
        <br><li>Honestly, this was a pretty troll game though, so I wasn't really taking anything seriously. It honestly worked out more effectively than I possibly could have imagined it would, but at the end of it all, I was just laughing at myself bc I thought the entire play was just hilarious more than anything. Hope you enjoyed as well.</li>

    <p class="second"><br><br><br><br>Aware Pharah
    <ul class="second">
        <li>This was honestly a much more crucial POTG then it looked like. I was having reload-fail issues (again -.-) w that stupid Bastion, so much so that I actually thought I was gonna die. Luckily I managed to escape that crap, and I caught that pocketed-Roadhog coming at me at the very last split-second out of the corner of my eye and pulled off the complete-instinct boop.</li>
        <br><li>It was pretty clutch bc it won us the point, which actually ended up winning us the match.</li>
        <br><li>Got a pretty high-praise comment from a teammate who thought it was pretty insane, so that felt good lol.</li>
    </ul>

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br>Decent Dart
    <ul>
        <li>There's not much background talk to give for this clip bc everything else is pretty mundane besides the dart itself.</li>
        <br><li>I'd be lying if I said I knew the Pharah would fall into the pit and die after I slept her, but it wasn't easy for me to hit that dart at all to begin with. The accidental boop on top of that just made it sweeter.</li>
