    Jumpshot on Airborne Pharah</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Not completely sure everybody would agree with this pick, but it's always been my personal choice.</li>
        <br><li>What made it special is that I was completely occupied with the enemies in front of me, who I took down, yet without any single thought of a Pharah possibly flanking from behind, I didn't freeze or hesitate for a second, and directly went for the highest-percentage kill shot I had available.</li>
        <br><li>The skill level of the jumping headshot of a Pharah in mid-flight on top of that was just icing on the cake.</li>
        </ul>

    <p class="second"><br><br><br>Jumpshot Genji Mid-Blade
    <ul class="second">
        <li>This clip was actually from my very earliest days becoming a Widow main, so my mechanics weren't nearly as good as they are now. I was still playing above-average Widow however, at least within the level of QP games that I was always playing.</li>
        <br><li>Memory is shady because it was such a long while ago, but I definitely remember I made the Genji rage. He started going after me and only me the entire game.</li>
        <br><li>This last shot was particularly based on anticipation. I actually saw him arrive on the point out of the corner of my eye, and I was just waiting for him to dash me. What I didn't realize was that he would blade, but by then I was already high in the air like I planned, and I managed to take him out with a fairly steadily-aimed shot.</li>
    </ul>

    Genji Blade Pure Instinct Headshot
    <ul>
        <li>Another Genji with serious rage issues all match, and it's not clear in the clip, but he was using that Blade completely to take me out first, and then anyone else he could get after.</li>
        <br><li>In these situations as a Widow, you basically only have one shot to live. I stayed calm, trusted my instincts, and I headshotted him right as he pushed dash. It was perfect timing and kind of a miracle shot esp given the fact that I could barely make out his hitbox in all the mess going on around him.</li>
    </ul>
