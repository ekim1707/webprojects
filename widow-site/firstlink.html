    <p>"The Bastion Apology Request"
        <ul>
        <li>This Bastion is everything that's wrong with the game. Joins game late and immediately acts obnoxious. Overly sensitive and defensive despite my genuine best efforts not to be mean. Actually thinks he's carrying the team when really he threw and almost made us lose in the end. I could go on and on.</li>
        <br><li>First round was a pretty emphatic victory for our team... after our team had to make the Bastion trade, things got iffy. It's not really anything new, but at times I felt like I was playing alone.</li>
        <br><li>Overall, despite the usual lag issues, was connecting very consistently on the shots I had to hit at least.</li>
        <br><li>Probably most impressive, highest IQ part of entire VOD was the ending. I knew the very second the enemy soldier would pop visor, and I made the only single play I could have to save the game for my team by grappling up where he couldn't hit me. Then I circled and waited for the very last moment when I could drop down to touch point, extend OT, and delay long enough for my team to get back from spawn</li>
        <br><li>Of course the best part was after the game was over when the Bastion took credit for the save and said "you have to thank me now" -.-</li>
        </ul>

    <p class="second">"The Unselfish Selfishness"
        <ul class="second">
            <li>Unlike pretty much 90% of ppl who play Quickplay a lot, I used to always try to be as unselfish as I can, even though, as pretentious as it may sound, I am undoubtedly always the best player at every position on my team. I'm not going to feel guilty about sounding arrogant there because I know for a fact it's true.</li>
            <br><li>I started this game by switching off from the most crucial DPS role to a more supportive healer role (Zenyatta) for no reason other than wanting to be nice. I quickly realized right from the start of round 1 that we were gonna be in trouble with our comp the way it was. But I didn't complain or selfishly switch back to a DPS either. I just tried my best for the team (look at the stats yourself).</li>
            <br><li>Second round spawn: I'm thinking, if I stay Zen, it's a guaranteed loss. And I'm pretty sure nobody on our team, including me, wants to lose the game for sure. So I just go for my best hero, which is obviously Widow. I think my second round performance speaks for itself.</li>
            <br><li>Even after I carried our team to an easy second round victory, and it was definitely 100% obvious to everybody in the server, STILL not a SINGLE one of these noob DPS teammates of mine have any inclination to think team first and switch-off. I know it's just QP, but it was still aggravating as hell after the show I just put up.</li>
            <br><li>I could either just stay Widow and try to pull off another solo carry, or I could try to fill the biggest desparate whole our team's comp needed, which was a shield tank. So of course my naive butt switched off again to Orisa, and then the video basically tells the rest of the story.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>This is really the best Bill Gates could do?
        <ul>
            <li>Not completely sure if it's evident yet if you've watched some of my videos already, but I have major computer spec issues. I have just about the cheapest junk "gamer" computers I could possibly play the game on. I use the cheapest level AT&T Fiber available at home. Even though I run off the absolute lowest game settings that Overwatch can offer, I still lag like a mad-man and deal with endless cpu performance issues while I play.</li>
            <br><li>Windows has this really really really stupid default setting where if you get any type of notification while in fullscreen game mode, for some unknown reason, it completely minimizes your screen without your consent just so you can see the notification. It makes absolutely no sense to me, and you would think the smartest and richest developers on the planet could think of a better design than this. I know there's a "do not minimize while in game mode" option, but I've tried to make it work a million times, and it doesn't for me.</li>
            <br><li>Right out of the gate, I started to get this weird feeling that something wasn't right. So I lingered an extra moment or two right in front of spawn to wait it out in safety. Once I heard those tiny footsteps behind me, I immediately knew what was happening. The fact I sniffed the Tracer out when the majority of Widow's would not have was a proud moment from the start.</li>
            <br><li>Missed some easy easy shots (see cpu performance issues), but still overall was helping my team far more than our other DPS. That Genji thought so highly of himself (at one point near the end he admonishes Ana "let me ask for nano first before you give it to me" like some kind of OWL pro, when if you watch the VOD closely enough, it's clearly evident that our Ana was carrying our team, perhaps including me. Whatever the case, he seemed like a very average-at-best Genji, and it felt like I was constantly picking up the slack for him.</li>
            <br><li>Absolute stupidest ending to any game ever. Random Windows notification right when our team is about to win. Screen minimizes; it doesn't disconnect, but at that point in the game I'm just blind, so there's basically nothing I can do. POTG tells the rest of the story.</li>
