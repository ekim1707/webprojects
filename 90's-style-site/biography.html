        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>Joel was the son of Brian Houston, who was the founder of the original Hillsong Church in Australia. In the early days, Joel served primarily
            as a bass guitarist for the main Hillsongs worship band, but eventually, he became one of the leaders behind the foundation of the more new-age, modern
            sub-division Hillsong United band, which included other driving, influencial forces in the Christian music industry like Marty Sampson and Brooke Frasier.
            Upon the move, Joel immediately also stepped into a new musical role as lead-singer and songwriter as well. From there, Joel's impact could not be
            ignored as he created several life-changing songs and spread his message to the world during countless live tours with the band.
