                <p>
                    Many people remember Joel for his breakout, historically-renown single, "From the Inside Out (Everlasting)".
                    Perhaps the most moving lyrics in this masterpiece come immediately in the introduction:<br><br>
                    A thousand times I've failed<br>
                    Your mercy remains<br>
                    Should I stumble again<br>
                    I'm caught in Your grace<br><br>
                </p></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/hillsongunited/solution.html">Solution</a><br>
                <p>
                    This hit song, Solution, was written as Joel's response to all the chaos and struggle circulating through
                    the world news at the time. Joel's simple assertion to the world was for the people of the world to rise
                    up through faith and be the instruments necessary to make a positive change.<br><br>
                    It is not too far a cry<br>
                    Too much to try<br>
                    To help the least of these<br>
                    Politics will not decide<br>
                    If we should rise<br>
                    And be Your hands and feet<br><br>
                </p></li>

                <p>
                    One of Joel's later, more passionate songs, this title song from the "Across the Earth: Tear Down
                    the Walls" album was one of his more low-profile ones. Still, the passion in his lyrics remains
                    clearly evident, in a song addresses some of the more darker struggles in different walks of life.<br><br>
                    Tear down the walls, see the world<br>
                    Is there something we have missed<br>
                    Turn from ourselves, long beyond<br>
                    There's so much more than this<br><br>

                    The image below will tell the story for this epic tune Joel managed to create towards the later part
                    of his career. This song continues to captivate audiences in church or in concert to this very day.
